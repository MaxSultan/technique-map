# V1

Hypothesis:
1000 reps in the 20% of wrestling that makes up 80% will get kids from novice to advanced

An overview of techniques
A way to quickly create practice plans
A way to visualize the hight level technique plan
A way to store content related to the technique

[x] Type map.tsx
[x] Add click on overlay to the panel component
[] Make practice plan boxed a fixed height for different areas
[] add a print/copy practice plan feature
[] make usable on mobile
[x] deploy
[] stop the same item from the same position being added more than once to a practice plan
[] group the items in the same area by position
[x] nx-ize the code
[] styling
[] make content adjust on resize
[x] create github repo
[] Add curved lines between svg circles
[x] remove from practice plan button
[] add error handling

nice to have
[] make the panel transition out of view nicely

# Modeling Wrestling Skill Aquisition

How do we model the skills, positions, knowledge, competencies,etc that you need to be good at for wrestling
How do we then turn that into a system?
What is the framework for building wrestling competency?
Wrestlers need to develop a set of skills, strength and conditioning, beliefs and attitudes

3 areas - top, bottom, neutral
positions make an area - bottom (base, belly, bottom, back)
move - a way to score points or change position

when someone does a move different than the way we teach it we say they have bad technique
when someone doesnt know the move they have no technique in that area
someone good at wrestling understands the following things in a position

1. what moves they have available
2. what the opponent has available
3. what "look" they need for a certain move to be effective
4. How to defend the opponents moves from this position
5. What comes next from a certain move and all previous for what comes next
